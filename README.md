# biomimetic-fish-simulation-robotics
Python project for simulating biomimetic fish locomotion — created for robotics master applications. Includes code, visualization, scientific context and discussion.

## General Overview
This project simulates the swimming motion of a biomimetic fish using Python, inspired by real aquatic locomotion and bio-inspired robotics.

The aim is to reproduce undulatory movement patterns similar to those observed in natural fish, leveraging mathematical models and programming for visualization and analysis.  

The simulation includes:
- Physical modeling of fish body segments and their sinusoidal motion.
- Visualization of an articulated fish swimming in two dimensions.
- Discussion of the biomimetic and robotics context, with links to aquatic robots.

This project is part of my master's application portfolio and demonstrates my interest in bio-inspired robotics, programming, and scientific communication.  
It also connects to my background in physics and data science, and supports my motivation to explore the link between living systems and robotics.
